## Activity Logs

The activity log displays all actions taken throughout your procurement flow, from intake to payment. It records what action was performed, by whom, and on which procurement document.

Activity logs are available for the following modules: Intakes, Requisitions, RFQs, Purchase Orders, Received Notes, and Invoices.

Go to the tabular view of any procurement module. Click on the action button (⋮) next to a record. Select ‘View Activity Log’ from the dropdown.

## Mark as On Leave

You can set a leave period in the system to ensure your pending approvals are automatically redirected to an alternate approver, preventing any interruptions in the procurement flow.

**To set a Leave Period:**
- Go to Profile Settings to access your Leave Periods page.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/137.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

- Click ‘Add Leave Period’ to create a new one.
<Frame>

</Frame>

- Select the start and end date for your leave, optionally add a reason, and click ‘Save’.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/139.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

- Your saved leave period will be displayed in a tabular view on the Leave Periods page.

When the start date arrives, any pending approvals you have will be automatically reassigned to your alternate approver. Any new approvals meant for you during your leave will also be assigned to your alternate approver.
On the end date, all unapproved tasks will be reassigned back to you.

Note: The leave period runs from the beginning of the ‘From Date’ to the beginning of the ‘To Date’. Also, you cannot save leave periods that overlap with existing ones.

While a leave period is active, you can edit it and change the end date to today or a future date.

Additionally, a privileged user with permission to edit users can save a leave period on behalf of another user.
To do this, go to <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/users" target="_blank">`Settings > User Management`</a>, click the action button (⋮) for the user, and select 'Leave Periods.' This will take you to the user's leave periods page, where you can add or edit leave periods on their behalf.

## Support Punchout Catalogs

We support punchout catalogs, which integrate your purchasing system directly with suppliers like Amazon or Staples. With punchouts, you can browse a supplier’s website, add items directly to your requisition, and complete the purchase automatically once the order is approved without needing to manually re-enter item details. This eliminates unnecessary steps, reduces errors, and keeps your purchasing process smooth and connected. Without punchouts, users would have to manually key in item information and separately place the order, creating friction and risks for document mismatches. Punchouts simplify the entire process.

### How to use Punchout Catalogs:

**Create a Requisition:**

- Go to <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/requisitions/create-new" target="_blank">`Purchasing > Requisitions > Create Requisition`</a>. Fill in the required header fields.
- Click on 'Add from Punchout Catalog'. A pop-up will appear where you select the punchout group and user. Only punchout groups matching the shipping address you selected will be listed. After selecting a group and a user, click 'Proceed'.
- You’ll be navigated to the vendor’s website. Browse, add items to your cart, and when ready, proceed to checkout and click 'Submit for Approval'.
- This will bring you back to your requisition with the cart items automatically added.
- Assign a category to each line item to link them to a GL account, and save the requisition.
- Punchout items will be indicated with the vendor's logo in the View page.

**Create a Purchase Order from the requisition:**

- View your requisition and select the punchout line items. Click 'Create PO'.
- Note: You must select all items from the same cart to create an order.
- The created PO will be saved as a draft. You can view it, link a budget to the order, and click 'Submit' to send it for approval.

Once the PO is approved, the system will automatically confirm the order with the punchout vendor and process the full payment. The vendor will deliver the ordered items according to their service terms.

**Edit POs of punchout items:**
If an approver sends the PO back for revision, the creator can update the expected delivery date, priority, budget, and item categories of a purchase order created for punchout items. Saving these changes will resubmit the PO for approval.

## Integrations & API Connectors
