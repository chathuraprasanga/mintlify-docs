## Onboarding

**Proculy's onboarding process is thoughtfully designed for ease and user-friendliness, ensuring efficient account management.** It's intuitive and straightforward, complemented by tooltips and simple instructions to ensure a seamless onboarding journey.

As a first-time user during the onboarding, you'll receive an overview of the steps needed to set up your organization's account, such as configuring user roles, adding users, managing financial master data, adding vendors, and creating categories. This guide will show you how the screens work and how to add new records, with helpful tooltips along the way.

A step is marked as completed when you add the first record (e.g., a user or role), indicating you have successfully followed the guide. However, to fully utilize the platform, you will need to add more records. Completing all these steps at this point is optional, and you have the flexibility to skip them if you prefer. However, you need to do these configurations to kick-start your account and fully utilize its capabilities. If you skip the step here, you can complete the configurations via the Main Menu.

As a first-time user, the onboarding process simplifies user setup immediately after creating an account. You can configure user roles, add users, manage financial master data, add vendors, and create categories by following the guided steps. On the dashboard, you will see an onboarding card that remains visible until all steps on the onboarding page are completed. Clicking on "Complete Setup" will take you back to the onboarding page. Steps in the onboarding process are marked as Completed when the first new record of the organization is created in each step. This indicates that the user has successfully navigated the screens and added a record. Once you have completed all the steps and they are marked as Completed, the onboarding card will be removed from your dashboard, signifying that your initial setup is finished.

## Setting up your account

After successfully completing the onboarding process, or skipping the step, you can navigate to your <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard.</a> Within this dashboard, you'll have super admin access, which we'll predominantly focus on for the sake of clarity in this documentation. Nevertheless, it's crucial to understand that you can include sub-users in your account and define their access according to their roles.

If the user skipped the onboarding step, the **"Complete Setup"** card will be visible at the top of the screen. The user can either click on **"Complete Setup"** to return to the onboarding page and see which settings remain to be completed or click on "Remind me later" to remove the card from the screen. A user can always use the <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Settings</a> page to complete the remaining steps for setting up the organization's account.

## Creating and Managing Item Catalog

Maintaining an Item Catalog is crucial for efficient procurement management. It allows your organization to manage a comprehensive list of frequently purchased items, complete with detailed specifications. This simplifies the process of creating intakes or requisitions, as users can easily select items from the catalog without needing to know the supplier or the exact price. Additionally, the item catalog can link each item to one or more authorized vendors, making vendor selection straightforward during purchase order creation. This also facilitates the creation of requests for quotes to identify the best vendors, ensuring cost-effective and streamlined procurement.

To add items to the item catalog, navigate through the usual path: <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/inventory/item-master" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`Menu > Purchasing > Item Catalog`</a>. This directs you to the item catalog management page, where you can efficiently add and manage your inventory items. This process ensures that your catalog is up-to-date and comprehensive, facilitating smooth and streamlined procurement activities.

<Tip>
    After clicking on that, the dashboard will show the item catalog table, presenting all the information.

        **Add Next Approver:** You can add multiple approvers for an approval level with assigned maximum threshold
        values for them. Approvers will be assigned based on their threshold values when a document is submitted for
        that approval level.

    <Accordion icon="user-secret" title="Final Approver">
        **Final Approver:** One of the approvers need to be set as the final approver who will be authorised to approve
        the corresponding procurement documents with no maximum threshold limit. You will not be able to save the
        approval level without setting a final approver.

    <Accordion icon="user-nurse" title="Alternative Approver">
        **Alternate Approver:** When an approver marks themselves as **"On Leave"** in the system, any approval requests
        assigned to them during their leave will be automatically redirected to their designated alternate approver.
        Once the leave period ends, all pending approvals will be reassigned back to the original approver.

When an approval level is applied to a document (intake, purchase order, received note, invoice), the system checks its total value. The document will be assigned sequentially from the first approver to the next within the approval level until it reaches an approver whose maximum threshold exceeds the document’s total value or the final approver.

    <Accordion title="Level Actions" icon="stairs">
        **Level Actions:** Besides Approve and Reject, activate the **“Send for Revision”** option. This allows the approver
        to send the document back for edits before resubmission.

        approvals linked to them.

        Reorganize the order of approval levels by dragging and dropping them. Documents will be assigned for applicable
        approval levels according to this order.

**Special Cases**

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/57.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

For documents that do not have a **“Total”** value to apply thresholds, such as Intake Requests and Received Notes Flow:

- The approval level creation page does not include a **“Minimum Threshold”** field or a list of multiple approvers.
- Assign a primary approver for all submitted documents for that approval level.
- Multiple approval levels can still be set up within the flow.
- By setting up and managing workflows in Proculy, you ensure that approval processes are tailored to your organization’s needs, providing a clear and efficient path for document approvals.
- Added approval levels can be reorganized to create the exact workflow order.

You can create department-specific approval levels for intakes. Ensure that the approval levels are correctly ordered in the approval levels table. When a document is sent for approval, only the relevant approval levels for that specific document will be assigned, following the order you have set in the table.
