## Initiating a Request in Intake

An intake is the initial request any employee can create to request goods or services. It is submitted at the department level and can follow a department-specific approval flow.
Once fully approved, the intake is automatically converted into a requisition, which is then managed by a procurement or sourcing professional within the company.

**How to create and manage an Intake**

**Create Intake**

On the left side of your screen, you will see the button **"Purchasing."** Clicking on it will expand the sub-menu items. There, you will see the <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/request" target="_blank">Intakes</a> button. Click it and then click on <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/request/create-new-request" target="_blank">Create Intakes</a>  to submit a simple request.
You will be directed to a form where you will have to fill in the necessary fields like **Title**
**Type of Request**, **Department**, **Priority level**, **Request (requesting items as a text)** and **Expected Delivery Date**.
Optionally, you can suggest vendors and/or assign a specific buyer within your company to handle this request.

</Frame>

Based on the type of request that you have selected, you can then proceed to **“Select from Catalog”** and optionally add items from the item catalog or the vendor catalog which lists all approved items from the registered vendors in Proculy.

    Once done with that, click save.
</Tip>


The saved intake will be submitted for approval according to the configurations set up in your workflow.


**Approve an Intake**

When an intake is submitted for approval, the assigned first-level approver will receive a system notification and an email. Through these notifications, the approver can view the intake, review it, and decide to approve or reject it.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/66.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

Alternatively, approvers can check their dashboard under **Your Involvement**, where the number of intakes pending their action is displayed. Clicking on this number will show the pending intakes awaiting approval. Click on the Intake ID to view the details.

## How to create and manage a requisition

A requisition is a document that can be used to list all requested goods and services at one place. A requisition is automatically created for an approved intake to transition the request into the procurement process.

You also have the option to create a requisition from scratch. Within a requisition, you can add required items with additional details and then proceed to create purchase orders or requests for quotes.

**Create Requisition**

On the left side of your screen you can see the button Purchasing. Clicking on Purchasing will expand the sub-menu items. There you have the <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/requisitions" target="_blank">Requisitions</a> button. Click it and click on <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/requisitions/create-new" target="_blank">Create Requisitions</a>.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/71.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

You will be directed to a form where you will have to fill in the necessary fields like **Title**
Type of **Purchase**, **Shipping address**, **Department**, **Delivery Date**
and  **Priority**, and line items.

Based on the selected purchase type, you can proceed to add requested items with quantities from either the item catalog or the vendor catalog, which includes all approved items from registered vendors in Proculy.
If the requested item is not available in either catalog, you can add text items to the requisition by clicking the **Add New Item** button.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/72.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

By using the checkbox **"Request to add this item into the Item Catalog,"** you can submit a request to add the new item to your company’s item catalog.

You can also add additional line item details, such as the vendor, unit price, and, if applicable, link a contract to the item.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/73.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

<Tip>
    If you wish to leave any additional information leave it on the notes.
</Tip>

Once done with that click save.

You can create purchase orders or requests for quotes from requisitions in pending status. Select the line items and click Create PO or Create RFQ. To create purchase orders, the selected line items must have a vendor and unit price assigned.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/74.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

**Edit Requisition**

When a requisition is created from an intake, click the edit button on the requisition's single view page or in the action buttons. From there, you can add line items and update the requisition to process it into purchase orders or requests for quotes.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/75.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

Any pending requisition can be edited, and the information for the pending line items (those for which a PO or RFQ has not been created) can be updated.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/76.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

## How to manage Purchase Order
You have two options to create a purchase order.

**Creating a Purchase Order from a Requisition**

Go to Purchasing on the left side of your screen and expand the sub-menu items. There you have the <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/requisitions" target="_blank">Requisitions</a> button. Click it and click on a  Requisition ID you want to view. Selecting line items in a requisition, will activate the **Create PO** button at the bottom. Click it and confirm, purchase orders will be created separately for the selected line items if the vendors are different.

Note: Purchase orders can only be created for items with a vendor selected and a unit price added.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/77.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

The created Purchase order(s) will be in Draft status, allowing you to add additional order related details before submission. Once submitted, the PO follows the configured approval workflow.

**Creating a purchase order from scratch**


To create a purchase order from scratch, go to Purchasing on the left side of your screen and click on <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/orders" target="_blank">Purchase Orders</a> in the sub-menu. At the right upper corner you have the <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/orders/create-new" target="_blank">Create Purchase Orders</a> button. Click it and fill all required data and add the line items with their information. Saving it will submit for approval.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/78.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

All created purchase orders are listed in the purchase orders page and a user can see the list of created orders with their status.

Statuses:
- **Draft:** When a PO is created from a requisition or RFQ it is saved as a draft, so a user can review and submit it.
- **Approval Pending:** The PO is still in approval
- **Send for Revision:** An approver has sent the PO for revision
- **Sent to Vendor:** PO is completely approved and has been sent to the vendor
- **Vendor Accepted:** The vendor has accepted the order
- **Partially Received:** Ordered items have been received partially and received notes have been created and approved in the system
- **Fully Received:** Ordered items have been received fully and received notes have been created and approved in the system


**Approving a Purchase Order**

When a purchase order is submitted for approval, the assigned first-level approver will receive a system notification and an email. Through these notifications, the approver can view the order, review it, and decide to approve or reject it.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/79.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

Alternatively, approvers can check their dashboard under **"Your Involvement"**, where the number of purchase orders pending their action is displayed. Clicking on this number will show the pending purchase order awaiting approval. Click on the order ID to view the details.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/80.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

<Tip>
    If any data needs to be changed, the approver can send the purchase order for revision.
</Tip>

**Editing a Purchase Order**

When an approver sends a purchase order you created for revision, you will be able to edit the purchase order. You can either view the order via the notification you receive or simply click on Purchase Orders under Purchasing and click on the PO ID you want to view. On the upper right corner you can see the Edit button. Alternatively, go to the Purchase Orders page, click the Actions button next to the PO, and select Edit.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/81.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

**Tracking POs Sent to Vendors**

When a purchase order (PO) is sent to a vendor, they can accept or reject the order via the Vendor Portal. If the vendor is not using the portal, you can manually update the PO status as **"Vendor Accepted"** or **"Vendor Rejected'** with a remark, on their behalf.
Received notes and invoices can only be created for purchase orders that have been accepted by the vendor.


**Actions for Vendor Accepted POs:**

When viewing a PO marked as ‘Vendor Accepted’, the following actions will be available:

**Prepayment:**
- A prepayment can be made for a purchase order before receiving an invoice.
- Click Prepayment, select the payment mode, and enter the amount.
- Payments can be made via credit card using Stripe or recorded for bank transfers, wire transfers, or other methods, with payment proof attached.

**Upload Invoice:**
- If you receive invoices outside the Vendor Portal, you can upload the received invoice as a PDF. For accuracy, add the invoice date and payment due date before uploading.
- The system will extract data using AI-powered OCR to create an invoice.

**Upload Received Note:**
- Instead of manually creating a received note, you can upload a packing slip in PDF format for the PO. Before uploading, add the received date and received note type for accuracy.
- The system will generate the received note using AI-powered OCR.

**Handling Partially Received Orders:**
- If an order includes an item with an under-receiving tolerance limit, and the received quantity falls within this limit but does not match the ordered quantity, the PO status remains ‘Partially Received’.
- If you want to mark the order as fully received, you can manually update the status as long as the received quantities remain within tolerance limits.
- When eligible, an ‘Update Status’ option with a ‘Fully Received’ button will appear.
- Add a remark and click the button to finalize the status.
-Once marked as ‘Fully Received’, no further received notes can be created for that order.

## How to work with Received Notes
Received notes are for recording the receival of your ordered items.

**Create Received Note**

Access the received notes page from <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/good-receiving/notes" target="_blank">`Receiving > Received Notes`</a>. All created Received Notes are listed in a tabular view.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/82.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
Clicking on the **"Create Received Note"** button on the top right corner of the page will open a modal to list all purchase orders in Vendor Accepted or Partially Received status. Only these orders are eligible for received notes. The filter options can be used to search for a purchase order. Click Select next to the desired purchase order to proceed to the received note creation page.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/83.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
<Info>
    Note: You cannot select a purchase order if a received note for it is still pending approval or in draft status. To
    prevent duplication, only one received note can be created at a time for the same order.
</Info>

The purchase order's line items will be displayed with ordered and pending quantities. Enter the received quantities in the Receiving field. You can remove line items that have not been received.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/84.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
When a received note is submitted for approval, the assigned first-level approver will receive a system notification and an email. Through these notifications, the approver can view the received note, review it, and decide to approve or reject it.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/85.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
Alternatively, approvers can check their dashboard under **"Your Involvement"**, where the number of received notes pending their action is displayed. Clicking on this number will show the pending received notes awaiting approval. Click on the received note ID to view the details.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/86.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
If any changes are needed, the approver can send the received note for revision.
When rejecting a received note, the approver has the option to save its details as a returned note. Created returned notes can be accessed under the Returned Notes tab
(<a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/good-receiving/notes" target="_blank">`Receiving > Received Notes > Returned
    Notes`</a>).

**Edit a Received Note**

A draft received note created by you can be edited and submitted for approval. Additionally, when an approver sends a received note you created for revision, you will be able to edit it. You can either view the received note via the notification you receive or simply click on Received notes under Receiving and click on the received note ID you want to view. On the upper right corner you can see the Edit button.
Alternatively, go to the received notes page, click the Actions button next to the received note, and select Edit. You can make necessary changes and resubmit for approval.

## How to manage invoices


To manage invoices and process them into payments, navigate to <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/invoices" target="_blank">`Accounts Payable > Invoices`</a>. Here, users can review all submitted invoices.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/88.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
You can click on the invoice ID to go to the single view page of an invoice and verify if they are:
- **2-Way Matched:** The invoice matches the ordered line items, quantities, and price details exactly or within the invoice tolerance levels (any previously approved invoices for the same PO are also considered into the total calculation).
- **3-Way Matched:** The invoice is 2-way matched, and the total received quantities match the total invoiced quantities or are within the invoice tolerance limits (any previously approved invoices for the same PO and all received notes created for the PO except for the rejected ones are considered into the total calculation).
- **Duplicated:** The invoiced quantities exceed the ordered quantities, or the same PDF invoice has been uploaded more than once.
Additionally, users can view linked budget details for the invoice. Once verified, approvers can approve the invoice for payment, ensuring an efficient and accurate invoicing process.

**Uploading Vendor Invoices**

If you receive invoices outside the system, you can upload a vendor invoice PDF to the corresponding purchase order (PO), provided that the PO has been accepted by the vendor.

To upload an invoice, navigate to <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/orders" target="_blank">`Purchasing > Purchase Orders`</a>. Open the relevant PO and click Upload Invoice.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/89.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>

**Managing Uploaded Invoices**

To view an uploaded invoice, go to <a href="https://buyer.proculy.com/app/invoices" target="_blank">`Accounts Payable > Invoices`</a>. Initially, the invoice status will be set to **"Queued"**. Once the invoice is successfully processed, the status will change to **"Approval Pending"** or **"Approved"** depending on the approval workflow set for invoices in the system. If the invoice does not require any approvals, it will be automatically approved and ready for payment.

If the invoice remains in the **"Queued"** status, click on the kebab menu (actions button) and select the **"Reprocess"** option to trigger the OCR and extract the data again.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/90.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
In case the uploaded document is invalid, the invoice status will show as **"Invalid"**.

To review and verify the invoice details, click on the Invoice ID to open the invoice view. You can check if the line items from the uploaded invoice have been correctly mapped with the corresponding purchase order line items. If necessary, use the **"Map Items"** button in the top-right corner of the line items table to manually map the invoice items with the order items.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/91.png" style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}/>
</Frame>
<Tip>
    Additionally, the uploaded PDF will be available as an attachment in the invoice view for reference.
