### Initiating a Request in Intake

An **Intake** is the initial request created by any employee to procure goods or services. It is department-specific and adheres to that department's customized approval flow. Once fully approved, the intake is **automatically converted into a requisition** for sourcing professionals to handle.

### How to create and manage an Intake
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="plus" title="Create Intake">
        On the left-hand navigation panel, click **Purchasing** to expand the sub-menu. Then click **Intakes**, followed by **Create Intake** to begin submitting your request.

        You'll be directed to a form where you must fill out the following mandatory fields:
        - Title
        - Type of Request
        - Department
        - Priority Level
        - Request (as text)
        - Expected Delivery Date

        Optionally, you can:
        - Suggest vendors
        - Assign a specific buyer from your company
    </Accordion>
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/64.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    <Accordion icon="list" title="Add Items from Catalogs">
        Based on the **Type of Request**, you’ll be able to:
        - **Select from Catalog** to choose approved goods/services
        - Browse both the **Item Catalog** and **Vendor Catalog** (registered vendor items)

        These help ensure consistency and compliance with procurement policies.
    </Accordion>
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/65.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
