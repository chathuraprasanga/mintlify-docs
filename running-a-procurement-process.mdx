### Initiating a Request in Intake

An **Intake** is the initial request created by any employee to procure goods or services. It is department-specific and adheres to that department's customized approval flow. Once fully approved, the intake is **automatically converted into a requisition** for sourcing professionals to handle.

**How to create and manage an Intake**
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="plus" title="Create Intake">
        On the left-hand navigation panel, click **Purchasing** to expand the sub-menu. Then click **Intakes**, followed by **Create Intake** to begin submitting your request.

        You'll be directed to a form where you must fill out the following mandatory fields:
        - Title
        - Type of Request
        - Department
        - Priority Level
        - Request (as text)
        - Expected Delivery Date

        - **Select from Catalog** to choose approved goods/services
        - Browse both the **Item Catalog** and **Vendor Catalog** (registered vendor items)

        These help ensure consistency and compliance with procurement policies.

### How to Make or Record Payments
**Payments**
Navigate to the Payments page via the main menu on the left: **Accounts Payable > Payments**. All recorded payments are listed in a tabular view.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/104.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>
There are two types of payments:
- **Prepayment**: Payment made before receiving an invoice.
- **Post-payment**: Payment made for approved invoices.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="plus" title="Make a Prepayment">
        A Prepayment can be recorded for a purchase order when you want to make a payment before receiving an invoice. To be able to make a prepayment, the purchase order needs to be accepted by the vendor.
        Go to **Purchasing > Purchase Orders** and click the PO ID of the order for which you want to make a prepayment.

        On the right side of the PO’s single view page, click **Prepayment** to open the payment modal.
        Select the payment mode and add the amount you are paying.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/105.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
        </Frame>
        - You can make a credit card payment through the system via **Stripe payment** (for that, the vendor account in the vendor portal needs to have a Stripe account configured).
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/106.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
        </Frame>
        - You can record a payment already made using other methods with a payment proof attachment.
        - When the purchase order is in a foreign currency, you need to enter the current exchange rate to make the payment.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/107.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
        </Frame>
        The successfully recorded prepayment will be listed in the Payments page, and when an invoice is received and approved, the prepayment will be linked to the invoice.
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion icon="plus" title="Make a Post-payment">
        A post-payment can be made to one or more approved invoices for a single vendor at once.
        Go to the **Payments page (Accounts Payable > Payments)** and click the **Create Payment** button on the upper right corner.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/108.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
        </Frame>
        To get a list of invoices that you can make payments for, you need to select a vendor and filter. A list of payment-ready or partially paid invoices for the selected vendor will be listed on the page.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/109.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
        </Frame>
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/110.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
        </Frame>
        Look for the invoice and enter the paying amount in the **‘Paying’** field. You will not be able to enter an amount more than the payable amount of the invoice. When the paying amount is added, the checkbox for the invoice will be activated. You can add paying amounts for multiple invoices to make the payment at once.
        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/111.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
        </Frame>
        Select all the invoices you want to add a payment to. A card will be displayed at the bottom of the page to show the selected invoices and the total amount you are going to pay. If you select invoices in different currencies, a separate card will appear for each currency.

        Select your payment mode. Here also, you can make a credit card payment through the system via **Stripe payment**. You can record a payment already made using other methods with a payment proof attachment.

        Submitting it will record the payments to the Payments page and also to the selected invoices. The Payment Status of the invoices will be updated accordingly as **Partially Paid** or **Fully Paid**.
